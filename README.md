## 🌟 About This Portfolio

This portfolio is designed to provide a seamless and engaging experience for visitors.  
It features a navigation bar that allows users to view one section at a time (About, Education, Skills, Experience, Projects, Certificates, Contact, Feedback), with smooth transitions and a modern animated background.

**Key Innovations:**
- **Animated gradient background** for a dynamic look.
- **Single-section navigation**: Only one section is visible at a time for focus and clarity.
- **Dark mode toggle** for user comfort.
- **Keyboard navigation** (left/right arrows) for accessibility.
- **Animated welcome modal** to greet visitors.
- **Custom thank you message** after feedback submission.
- **Responsive design** for all devices.
